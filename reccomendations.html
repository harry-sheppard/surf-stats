			<h3>Seasonal Variation</h3>
			<div style="display:inline-block">

				<div style="background-color:#FFF6; padding: 20px 20px 70px 20px; margin: 10px;">
				<p>There is a clear sinusoidal pattern to the mean monthly wave heights. 
				Due to stronger winds and larger storms during the winter months, average 
				waves are as much as two times bigger than during the summer, with the peak
				lying in January.</p>
				<p>For beginners, young childen, or older adults, the ideal period to surf
				is between May and September. Outside this season, waves are larger, faster,
				more powerful, and more dangerous. Temperatures are also, of course, higher,
				 reducing the danger of hypothermia.</p>
				<p>Surfers with more experience can venture out outside this season, and may
				in fact find the summer waves inadequate. However, with winter comes a drop
				in air and sea temperatures, increasing risk of hypothermia. Proper equipment,
				such as winter wetsuits, should always be worn.

			<h3>Ideal Surf Spots</h3>
			<div style="display:inline-block">
				<img class="recco_img" src="map.png" alt="graph of mean height vs location" style="float:left">
				<p style="background-color:#FFF6; padding: 20px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 100px">Though the East Coast of Ireland isn't entirely lacking in waves, the West 
				Coast recieves the brunt of the Atlantic's strong weather. As such, the concentration
				of larger waves (shown in yellow) is much higher, especially around Sligo, Mayo, and Galway.</p>
				<p style="background-color:#FFF6; padding: 20px; margin: 0px">Similarly, on the Bay of Biscay, the French Coastline gets larger, more powerful waves
				than the North of Spain. This is due to the prevailing wind and wave direction, coming
				from the South-West. France's coastline faces West and gets hit harder than Spain's
				North-facing shores.</p>
				<p style="background-color:#FFF6; padding: 20px; margin: 0px">Choice of surf spot is important regardless of ability. Exposed, wilder areas are
				a poor choice for beginners to the sport, and total novices should keep to the
				more sheltered, safer areas shown in light green. These spots will provide enough of a
				challenge to develop skills, without unnecessary peril.</p>
				<p style="background-color:#FFF6; padding: 20px; margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 150px;">For avid, experienced surfers, better conditions can be found in the yellower
				areas of the map, particularly during the summer months when the average spot may
				prove unsatisfactory.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>

				<p style="margin-top: 100px;">When planning surf trips, one should always take into account ability levels,
				time of year, and location. Safety should always come first, and even the most 
				experienced of surfers should always be aware of their limits. In Australia alone,
				from 2004 to 2020, there were 155 deaths of surfers of varying skill levels.
				(Lawes JC, Koon W, Berg I, van de Schoot D, Peden AE, The epidemiology, 
				risk factors and impact of exposure on unintentional surfer and bodyboarder deaths.)
				However, when done properly, with correct preparation and safety procedures, surfing
				can be a fun, exciting sport to be enjoyed by all.</p>
